    <p id="paragraph">It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life.
         When a person leads a disciplined life, they set an easy path to success.
          They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead.
           Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working.
            An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young.
             Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life make it a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
